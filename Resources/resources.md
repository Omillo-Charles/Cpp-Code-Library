## 💡 Pro Tips

### ⚡ Accelerate Your Learning

- ✅ **Code Every Day** - Even 30 minutes beats 3 hours once a week
- ✅ **Read Others' Code** - Study open-source projects on GitHub
- ✅ **Build Projects** - Theory without practice is useless
- ✅ **Use Debuggers** - Don't just use `cout`, learn proper debugging
- ✅ **Teach Others** - Best way to solidify your knowledge

### ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Skipping the basics to jump to "cool" topics
- ❌ Not learning modern C++ (C++11 and beyond)
- ❌ Only watching tutorials without coding
- ❌ Giving up when facing memory management
- ❌ Not asking for help when stuck

### 🎯 C++ Standards Evolution

```
C++98  → Legacy (avoid)
C++03  → Legacy (avoid)
C++11  → Modern C++ begins! ✅ START HERE
C++14  → Minor improvements ✅
C++17  → Major features ✅
C++20  → Huge update (modules, concepts) ✅
C++23  → Latest standard ✅
```

> 💡 **Focus on C++11 and beyond.** Modern C++ is safer, cleaner, and more expressive.
